      <h1 class="std">Introduction</h1>
<p>The digital transformation of the construction industry fully interests the production chain of construction involving related activities as manufacturing, certification, promotion, marketing, procurement, selection, supply, transportation, transformation, assembly, installation, maintenance and replacement over the time.</p>
<p>Moreover, the supply chain of construction needs a complete digitalization of information transactions sharing \\\<em>\\\<em>data\\\</em>\\\</em> and product \\\<em>\\\<em>characteristics\\\</em>\\\</em>. Hopefully, the above-mentioned supply chain should comply to the digital standards conventionally used in the design, construction and maintenance stages.</p>
<p>Both \\\<em>\\\<em>digital models\\\</em>\\\</em> and other \\\<em>\\\<em>information containers\\\</em>\\\</em>, functional to the construction world, need to be read and nurtured, both in input and output, using a suitable, standardized and accepted digital syntax. This will grant the modernization and automatization of dialogues that will eventually and gradually evolve into the so-called \\\<em>\\\</em><em>machine-to-machine</em>\\\<em>\\\</em> transactions.
This standard contains of two parts.</p>
<p>The \\\<em>\\\<em>Part 1\\\</em>\\\</em> includes basic structures, that are reusable also by Part 2 (shared elements) and defines the basic structure for products as a list of product types and products.
The \\\<em>\\\<em>Part 2\\\</em>\\\</em> includes the structures that are used to express requirement requests and responses as declarative expressions.</p>
<h1>Purposes for product data exchange</h1>
<p>The following purposes where identified in the context of digital product data exchange.</p>
<h2>Detailed digital description of a product</h2>
<p>In order to identify a product and understand the function of a product a technical description is needed. This standard allows the exchange of a product description, technical and business properties, geometry, assets like pictures and mounting instructions in a digital data sheet.
This digital product description could be used for design, specification, quotation processes and complete an as-built-model.</p>
<h2>Bills of quantity (templates)</h2>
<p>With digital product data it is easy to create bills of quantities of different products. The better understanding of the digital properties allows deeper Bills of quantities with more search options. Also, the transport from one design stage to the next one is improved.</p>
<h2>Procurement and Product purchase</h2>
<p>The digital product description with standardized structure and properties makes searches in catalogs easier and automatable. It will be possible to query product properties across vendors and points of sales.
The purchase of products will be more reliable if the product features and performances are digital available. The creation of order and delivery forms could be improved and universally used.
Also, eBusiness processes are affected positively.</p>
<h2>Construction site management (Logistic)</h2>
<p>During construction phases, site managers assure day by day operations to keep the construction project on time and on budget. They also manage quality controls and the correspondence between built progresses and design’s prescriptions.
All players operating on site, both supervisors and contractors, exchange data related to products. Contractors receive design specification and according to them require product data to suppliers. All suppliers shall comply technical requirements and site inspectors should verify through technical check during site procurement and quality check during installations.
All data related to construction products, within construction site management will be variously demanded: technical specification, purchase orders, installation procedures, compliance with standards, checklists, etc.<br>
Exchange of product data sheet also involve commissioning team, originally informed during materials approval and then responsible of certifications related to corrects performances, functionalities and warranty.</p>
<h2>As Built and handover</h2>
<p>Import delivered real life products easily in their as-built-bim-models to document them for a later stage of development.</p>
<ul>
<li>Reorder spare parts, product maintenance</li>
<li>Declaration of performances, of conformity, …</li>
<li>Onsite assembly</li>
</ul>
<p>The enrichment or lowering with single properties of a product can be handled easy with a product exchange format.</p>
<h2>Safety &amp; Risk management</h2>
<p>Jobsites are complex environments, with workers interacting in challenging physical environments. Safety management has impacts on most construction operations: quality control, scheduling, cost control/budgeting and installations procedures. During all these phases, operators interact exchanging required documents in conformity to standards and regulations.
About particular products commonly adopted like paints, silicones, thinners or premixed concretes, the Safety Coordinator at Execution Stage should approve their Safety Data Sheets provided by Manufacturers.
On the construction site, however, the Health, Safety and Environment Coordinator deals not only with products but also with tools and machines through which the Contractor take advantages. Just think for example to work equipment, safety life lines and harnesses, lifting ropes, scaffoldings, cranes etc.
Presence on site of such tools involves exchange of data and information actually only partially digitalized: CE certification or mark, operation and maintenance manual, periodic checks, authorizations and, sometimes, structural validation.</p>
<h2>Provide digital product declaration</h2>
<p>Digital product data also improves the creation, the transport, the interpretation and the documentation of all kinds of product declaration. This is a benefit for safety and quality.
For Example:</p>
<ul>
<li>DoP: Declaration of performance</li>
<li>DoC: Declaration of conformity</li>
<li>EPD: Environmental Product Declaration</li>
<li>Compliance to Smart CE marking</li>
</ul>
<p>See appendix 9.9.</p>
<h2>Manufacturer digital information exchange (independent of online markets)</h2>
<p>Manufacturers provide products’ catalogues through their website. All kinds of data can be easily shared online, but a complete digital revolution forecast possibility to express and exchange machine readable information.</p>
<p>Currently websites allow download sections with geometric and not geometric informative attributes. Tridimensional parametric models are often linked to authoring BIM formats with few possibilities of ensuring interoperability and unique structured language. Another disadvantage consists in data redundancy due to difficulty in representing information with a single digital format.</p>
<p>All these inconveniences bring to subsequent need of standards for representing machine readable data and for demanding the guaranty of interoperability to software houses. This also brings to an update of manufacturers’ website in terms of exchange of data and possibility to store new structured Product Data Sheets in external servers.</p>
<p>And Relationship between manufacturers and agents/distributors/shops/vendors (e.g. digital exchange of product libraries in the supply change)</p>
<ul>
<li>Local Online store on the website of a manufacturer</li>
</ul>
<p>Digital Request: Part 2
Response: Part 1 or Part 2, depending on the format, the users of the website uses</p>

<h2>Ability to check contract/design deliverables</h2>
<p>Check of the as-built-product against the designed product is possible with a comparison of both digital product data. The comparison could happen on product or property level. This allows a product delivery validation on site or later.</p>
