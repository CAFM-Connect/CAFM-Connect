<p>Building Information Modelling (BIM) can be used a a method to plan build and operate buildings in a digital and collaborative way. One core aspect of BIM is the possibility to store information about buildings in a consistent and comprehensive digital model. The standard EN ISO 16739-1:2018 defines an open and vendor neutral structure for these building models. The application of this standard enables all stakeholder in the construction industry to exchange the models, or to exchange parts of the models, based on their use cases.
The present standard defines a subset of EN ISO 16739-1:2018, that can be used to describe, store and exchange single construction objects or a set of construction objects, e.g. construction products or other model elements. The entirety of the objects together, then again results in the model of the building.
The standard is applicable in the phases of planning, building and operating of buildings. The standard defines related aspects, especially how to</p>
<ul>
<li>store and exchange data templates for construction objects based on EN ISO 23386 and EN ISO 23387</li>
<li>store and exchange data sheets that include the specifiy information for for construction objects
The seamless compatibility to EN ISO 16739-1:2018 enables the users of this standard to assembly the information about construction objects in the model of the building.</li>
</ul>
