<h2 class="std">8.4 IfcGeometricConstraintResource</h2>
<h3 class="std">8.4.1 Schema Definition</h3>
<p>The schema <i>IfcGeometricConstraintResource</i> defines the resources used to determine the placement of the shape representation of a product within the geometric representation context of a project. It also contains resource definitions to be assigned to product connectivity definitions to determine the connection geometry constraints between those products.</p>
<p>The primary application of this resource is to:</p>
<p>\\\\\\\\\\\\\\* determine the object placement used for the shape representation of the object
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\* determine the constraints applied to the connectivity between two shapes of objects</p>
<h4>8.7.1.1 Placement</h4>
<p>The placement of an product's shape is given by the <a href="../ifcgeometricconstraintresource/lexical/ifcobjectplacement.html">IfcObjectPlacement</a>, used by the attribute <i>ObjectPlacement</i> of <a href="../ifckernel/lexical/ifcproduct.html">IfcProduct</a>. The object placement defines the local object coordinate system in which all shape representations of that product are defined. It is given either as</p>
<p>\\\\\\\\\\\\\\* absolute placement,
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\* the absolute placement is specified by using <i>IfcLocalPlacement</i> and omitting the <i>PlacementRelTo</i> attribute;
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\* relative placement,
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\* the relative placement is specified by using <i>IfcLocalPlacement</i> and pointing the <i>PlacementRelTo</i> attribute to an <a href="../ifcgeometricconstraintresource/lexical/ifcobjectplacement.html">IfcObjectPlacement</a> used in another <a href="../ifckernel/lexical/ifcproduct.html">IfcProduct</a> instance;
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\* placement relative to a grid,
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\* the placement relative to a grid is specified by using <i>IfcGridPlacement</i> pointing to one (or two) virtual intersections of <i>IfcGridAxis</i>. If two virtual intersections are references, than the second virtual intersections specifies the orientation of the object placement. Alternatively the direction can also be provided explicitly by ifcDirection.</p>
<blockquote class="note">
<p>NOTE  When using relative placement the shape representation of each product is defined in the local object coordinate system provided by <i>ObjectPlacement</i>. That local object coordinate system is defined relative to the object coordinate system referred to by <i>PlacementRelTo</i> which may be a relative placement as well. Finally the <i>ObjectPlacement</i> not having an <i>PlacementRelTo</i> attribute defined the transformation into the global coordinate system. The transformation of the current coordinate system into the parent coordinate systems have to be applied in that order.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>8.7.1.2 Connection geometry</h4>
<p>The connection geometry defines the connectivity between the shapes of two products. The constraint can be defined by geometric representation items:</p>
<p>\\\\\\\\\\\\\\* point
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\* curve
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\* surface
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\* solid</p>
<p>or by topological representation items with associated geometry:</p>
<p>\\\\\\\\\\\\\\* vertex point
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\* edge curve
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\* face surface
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\* closed shell</p>
<p>As a special type of point connection includes the provision to express an eccentricity, i.e. a physical distance between the two points involved in the connection.</p>
