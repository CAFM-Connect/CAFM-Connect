<h4><a id="data sheet exchange" name="data sheet exchange">1.1.2 Data sheet exchange</a></h4>
<p class="std">
<p>The &quot;Data sheet exchange&quot; describes how concrete data on Constructions objects (e.g. building products) can be structured and exchanged. The description of data sheets for construction objects requires that the data templates as defined above have been agreed upon and are applied.</p>
<p>With data sheets, concrete construction objects can be described digitally, e.g. a digital description of concrete, existing, completely defined products (heating types) or real existing product instances (heating), based on the agreed data templates.
Data sheets of Construction objects contain</p>
<ul>
<li>Descriptive characteristics based on the characteristic definition from the data templates</li>
<li>Descriptive documents, such as PDF files, photos and other files with further information</li>
<li>References to one or more classification systems (such as Omniclass or Uniclass)</li>
</ul>
<p>One or more products that are fully defined and can be ordered, delivered to the site and installed into the building.</p>
