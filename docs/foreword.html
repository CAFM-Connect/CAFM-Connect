<p>CAFM-Connect is an initiative of associations and institutions that are committed to the standardization of digital data management in the planning, construction and operation of buildings. CAFM-Connect is a standard to exchange data of facilities based on EN ISO 16739 (IFC4). It is available to all stakeholders as an open interface for BIM in facilities management. With CAFM-Connect it is possible to securely exchange data of buildings between compatible software systems without any individual agreement.</p>
<p>Today, the planning and construction phase for real estate is dominated by the ever shorter time available for planning and erection. At the same time, there is an increasing number of people involved in the planning and construction process who have to be coordinated.</p>
<p>This is where BIM can help. Everyone involved works together on a common 3D building data model. Changes that occur during the process are synchronised automatically. In addition, BIM is regarded as a process support system with which the companies involved in a building project can electronically concatenate their processes.</p>
<p>In Germany, a number of building projects are already being realised with the help of the BIM process. Initiatives such as buildingSMART e.V. provide valuable assistance here.</p>
<h1>BIM in the operation of properties</h1>
<p>After a building has been built, it often changes owner once or several times. At the same time, the question arises as to the advantages offered by BIM in the management of existing properties.</p>
<p>The break in the &quot;ownership chain&quot; and the fields of work and responsibilities of the various individuals involved such as asset manager, property manager, tenant, building manager as well as specialist/crafts enterprises that are difficult to transfer effectively means that (despite every effort) the data collected during the construction phase of a property can only be used inadequately and with considerable effort during operation of the building. What's more, newly built buildings are frequently incorporated in a larger portfolio of existing properties. The data for these properties is generally not on a par with that of the new buildings so that updating the high quality of data for the new buildings usually poses problems and is often dropped.</p>
<p>The question of the benefit of updating the data plays a major role here and has to be considered as a key point in the development and use of BIM methods during the operational phase of real estate. In order to recognize the benefits of BIM for those persons active during operation, the processes, roles and their business models first have to be identified. There are a variety of roles during the operational phase, e.g. property owner and user, property manager, facility manager or technical service. An &quot;Operator BIM&quot; is then a system in which these roles are linked to each other in an electronically-integrated process.</p>
<p>However, it is difficult to identify processes that can serve as globally superior guidelines. It is therefore important to define document types such as sales and rental agreements, object lists, orders, service tickets, etc. that are exchanged between the parties in the exercise of the key processes. The wide variety of different types of data and documents makes it clear that an &quot;Operator BIM&quot; can be more than a technical reproduction of the building and/or the updating of CAD plans. One only has to consider an existing object list as a starting point for approvals and defects management as well as for the tendering and contracting of services.</p>
<p>The BIM approach extends today's purely document-based exchange of information by the exchange of structured information based on the building data model. The structured data of the property and corresponding documents are linked together.</p>
<h1>Transition from construction to operation</h1>
<p>The companies involved in both the construction and operational phase of properties can decide to use BIM processes. Appropriate standard and IT systems already exist to get started with BIM in both phases of the property life cycle. The concatenation of the construction and operational phase can also be decisively improved by the use of BIM. The BIM model for the property in the construction phase is hereby established by the parties involved. During the construction phase, the building processes are handled via the BIM model. During the transition to the operational phase, the data relevant for operation is extracted from the BIM model and transferred to the operational phase. It can be updated here and also used during the subsequent transfers of ownership. The extraction of the data relevant for operations reduces the volume to those elements that are relevant for operation, thus simplifying the updating of the data over the complete life cycle of the property.</p>
