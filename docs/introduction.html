<h1>The Open-BIM interface for the exchange of real estate data - Planning, building, operating with one data standard</h1>
<p>A clean and complete overview of a building's data is essential for safe and legally compliant operation. Before the building is completed, it is planned and built. During the planning and construction phase, two scenarios often arise: Building data is recorded that cannot be automatically used for the subsequent software system in operation (CAFM system) or no data is recorded at all. Result: Data must now be entered manually, which costs time and money. An annoyance that can be avoided: with CAFM-Connect.</p>
<p>CAFM-Connect is an initiative of associations in the real estate industry that are committed to the digitalisation of real estate operations and have created a uniform and open data standard based on IFC to simplify cooperation in the industry.</p>
<p>CAFM Connect consists of :</p>
<p>BIM Profiles</p>
<ul>
<li>Data exchange standards for BIM use cases in building operations</li>
<li>Contractual basis for customer information requirements (AiA)</li>
<li>Published by experts with a high level of knowledge about the respective application</li>
</ul>
<p>CAFM Connect Editor</p>
<ul>
<li>Software program for recording buildings and their components and documents on the basis of BIM profiles</li>
<li>Usability in compatible CAFM systems</li>
<li>Usable without installation as viewer or editor on every workstation</li>
<li>Free of charge</li>
</ul>
